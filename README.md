# LXZE's 2022 Advent of Code solutions

This repository was established to be a dedicated archive of my solutions for problems in [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).  
Each day's solutions (1 for the first part, 2 for the second part, obviously) and input files (test.txt for the test case, input.txt for the actual one) are separated into a folder named with its released date.  

Read it at your own risk.
